/*Certainly, let's break down each line of the code and explain the purpose of each word:

const cameraFeed = document.getElementById('camerafeed');

This line declares a constant variable named cameraFeed and assigns it the value returned by the document.getElementById('camerafeed') expression.
document.getElementById('camerafeed') is used to select an HTML element with the id attribute set to "camerafeed" in your HTML document.
The selected HTML element (in this case, it's assumed to be a <video> element) is stored in the cameraFeed variable for later use.
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })

navigator.mediaDevices is an object that provides access to media input devices, such as cameras and microphones, using the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) API.
getUserMedia is a method provided by navigator.mediaDevices that is used to request access to media input devices.
{ video: true } is an object passed as an argument to getUserMedia. It specifies that we want to access the user's video camera (video: true) for video streaming.
.then(stream => {

This line begins a Promise chain using the .then() method.
stream is a parameter representing the media stream (camera feed) obtained when the user grants permission.
cameraFeed.srcObject = stream;

Here, we set the srcObject property of the cameraFeed HTML element to the stream we obtained earlier.
This connects the camera feed to the <video> element, making it display the live video stream from the user's camera.
})

This closes the .then() block, indicating the successful execution of the Promise chain.
.catch(error => {

This line begins a new Promise chain using the .catch() method, which handles errors that may occur during the process.
console.log("Error", error);

In the event of an error during the getUserMedia request (e.g., if the user denies access to the camera or there is another issue), this line logs an error message to the console.
error is a parameter representing the error object.
});

This closes the .catch() block, indicating the end of the error handling code.
